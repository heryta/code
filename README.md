DIY e-Percussion Code
I'm building some DIY electronic percussion instruments, and I'm starting off doing tests for different functions for use with a micro-controller
Such as:
-- Buttons, Potentiometers, connecting piezos for triggers, connecting external footswitch pedals etc.

Here are some codes samples that have worked for me, for anyone to learn from and use how they like! 
I'm new to coding and basing most of what I do from other examples I've found, so be sure to look up those examples which I link to for
better explanations!
